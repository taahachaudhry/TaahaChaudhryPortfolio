            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
              Idean is a global creative design agency dedicated to delivering the best possible CX, UX, &amp; UI.
              Here at Idean, we began the process with user insight and

            <h1>&#8544;: Dispute Management Tool</h1>
            <p>
              At my first project at Idean, I, along with a Lead Senior UI Developer, built an online dispute resolution management tool.
              I mainly took care of the common components and the structure of the web application, while implementing some functionality.
              Some of the technologies used were Backbone.js with Marionette.js, Underscore.js, and jQuery, along with build tools,
              such as Bower, Gulp, Sass and r.js, and an AMD pattern.

            <h1>&#8545;: 1st Hour Site Onboarding Experience</h1>
            <p>
              My second project at Idean was developing the redesign of the 1st hour of onboarding for a service that matched caregivers and families together.
              I built the main structure of this web application, along with some functionality implemenation.
              This application was built mainly using React.js with Flummox, jQuery, and a few build tools,
              such as Bower, Gulp, Sass. We decided to use React.js for its faster rendering due to the virtual DOM and the ability to
              isomorphically render HTML server-side, for SEO optimization.
            </p>

            <h1 class="title">&#8546;: TV Prototype</h1>
            <p>
              For my first solo project at Idean, I developed a simple operator story experience prototype to be presented on TVs at a European conference.
              This simple application was built on a very tight and short dealine, so I stuck to building a simple HTML and CSS application with JavaScript
              and Gulp. This was a fun project, as I was challenged to write the styles optimized for TVs. I also only needed to support the
              lastest Chrome browser so I was able to use the newest and fanciest tools, such as Flexbox.

            <h1>Objective</h1>
            <p>
              To redesign and develop my portolio site for a better, simpler, and more concise User Experience and User Interface
              for recruiters, developers, and users to be able to view my skills, work, and resume.
            </p>

            <h1>Design Process</h1>
            <p>
              I began this redesign by collecting feedback on my current portfolio site from other designers and recruiters.
              Two points were mainly derived from the feedback that I recieved.
              One is to remove unnecessary features and visual aesthetics (such as the hero section) to create a more concise and simpler UX.
              The second point is to understand what the content the users wants to see and restructuring the hierachy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on the feedback that I gained from the user research that I conducted, I began writing out ideas and creating solutions to redesign the site.
              Thereafter, I began sketching low-to-mid fidelity wireframes and implementing the visuals using Sketch.
            </p>

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>
              I first began by listing out the important components, which would dictate the structure of the application.
              The most important component is the display of my work, which is the purpose of this application,
              should be the first thing that users should be able to see, upon entering the site.
              Each project should also contain a process or walkthrough, or even a description, and anything else related to the projects.
              Other components included the about section, resume, and contact.
            </p>
            <p>
              By understanding the components for the application and the feedback I recieved, I created ideas of how I was going to build the wireframes.
              I decided to remove unnecessary items, such as the hero components or quote, and remove animated functionality,
              and combine items where possible, such as displaying my skills through the project descriptions.
              I also wanted to create a smooter way to navigate through the site,
              so I decided to have a left-side navigation panel, which would also contain my contact information and social links.
              I also came up with a better hierarchy and structure for displaying project content.
            </p>

            </a>

            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>
              I decided to build this site myself using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript, along with some libraries, such as Animate.css, jQuery, and Masonry.
              I also used Gulp to build tasks, such as compiling my Sass files, linting, and browserify to use require in the browser by bundling up my dependencies.
              The biggest advantage I had using Gulp was a way to create a separate directory, which contained the HTML files, compiled Sass files, JavaScript files, and assets.
              By having this separate directory of compiled code, I was able to use Github pages to host my site, while still being able to code using Gulp and SCSS, and commit
              code as I normally would to a main repository.

            <h1>Objective</h1>
            <p>
              [freespace] is a way to connect those with unused or underutilized space with the local community for civic innovation.<br>
              During the two day ATX Hack for a Change Hackathon (June 2014) we were challenged by [freespace]ATX to design and develop a platform for users
              to be able to either request or offer a space to use.
            </p>

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p>
              We were a team of about 10 developers and designers. Considering this was a two day hackathon, we had to work together to get an minimum viable product out by
              the end of the weekend. The first thing we did is sit together and understand the non-profit and existing site. Thereafter, we figured out the most important components
              that can be built in the span of two days, which was the marketing page and the ability to request and offer a space. Two teams were formed at this point, the designers
              and the developers.
            </p>

            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>
              Since most of us developers had a Ruby on Rails background, we unanimously decided to build it on that framework and host in on Heroku. While a few developers began writing
              the UI structure the designers had mocked up, I, along with a few other back-end developers sat together and figured out the database schema and classes of the application. We
              created a task board containing a backlog, current, and completed tasks, and assigned tasks to ourselves. I took on the tasks to build aspects relating to the user from the user login and
              initial user dashboard, aling with a few admin features.<br>

              <span class="tagline">Tech Stack: Ruby on Rails, Twitter Bootstrap, Heroku, PostgreSQL Database</span><br>
              <span class="tagline">Note: [freespace]ATX may have reverted back to the general WP site, as no was maintaining the site after the hackathon.</span><br>
            </p>

            <h1>Takeaways</h1>
            <p>
              I learned quite a few things at my first big hackathon. The first was being to build a MVP in two days by working with such a large team. This was also my first time collaborating with other designers
              and having to make updates and changes as they were given to us, and seeing the product evolve from mockups to an actual visually appealing product. I also realized the benefit we would have had of conducting
              better research and asking questions, such as maintenance of the site after the hackathon was over, to better build a product.
