              Hello.<br/>
              My name is Taaha Chaudhry &amp; I build things.<br/>
              I love design &amp; I write code.<br/>
              I analyze data &amp; I solve problems.<br/>
              I explore the world &amp; the endless possibilities life has to offer.

          <div class="about-content">
            <p>
              Currently, I am a UI Developer at <a href="http://www.idean.com/" target="_blank">Idean</a> in the San Francisco Bay Area.
              Idean is a global creative design agency dedicated to delivering the best possible Customer Experiences, User Experiences, &amp; User Interfaces.
              Here at Idean, I worked closely with project managers, interaction and visual designers, and developers to implement beautiful pixel-perfect designs
              and front-end solutions for mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms. With a design and detail oriented mindset, I strive to create awesome user experiences
              for projects across different industries and clients.
              The agency environment has allowed me to expand my skillset very quickly by being able to work in a number of varying frameworks and technologies,
              such as Sass, Backbone.js, Angular.js, and more recently and often, React.js with Redux.
              With our dThis gave us the ability to cater a very crafted solution and implementation that will best suit our clients.
            </p>

            <p>
              Even though I am a developer, design fascinates me. I spend time understanding why something is designed a certain way,
              learning about design techniques, and appreciate good design.
              I look at products that could be redesigned to enhance my design skills.
              This includes thinking of ways of creating a better user experience or having a more visually appealing interface.
              Aside from design, I always try to keep with the latest and newest frameworks and front end development best practices.
              I continuously build my front end development skills at work and outside of work through building side projects that I am passionate about.
              My currect side project is building a travel diary tracker, using React.js, Redux, Mapbox, and D3.js.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also love analyzing data and figuring out ways that solutions can come about from these data sets to solve problems.
            </p>

            <p>
              I enjoy traveling, which opens up my creativity and helps me understand endless possibilities and solutions to problems.
              Through exploring the natural beauty of this world,  meeting people of various backgrounds, and experiencing different cultures,
              I have been able to broaden my perspective and views about different aspects of life.
